*************************************
Renewal of support from Seven Bridges
*************************************


I am happy to announce that Seven Bridges has renewed their support of my work
as the Community Engineer for the Common Workflow Language project through the
end of March 2017. Additionally, I am no longer working for the University of
California, Davis but am now an independent researcher. Big thanks go to my
now-previous boss, C. Titus Brown, for an incredible, life-changing three
years as a Research Software Enginner first at Michigan State University and
then at the University of California, Davis.

While it wasn't my original plan to go "solo" it does allows the money to
stretch further. It also simplifies life as I am a "trailing" spouse for at
least another year (next stop: back to Romania in August!) My husband and I are
very excited about, and only slightly horrified at, not knowing which continent
we will be based out of in 2017 :-)
