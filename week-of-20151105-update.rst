****************************************
Weekly report for the week of 2015-11-05
****************************************

This is the third weekly update on what I've been doing for the CWL; it covers
the week of 2015-11-05.

Summary: FoG Workshop & Dev summit were a huge success!

Monday 2015-11-05
-----------------

- Dealt with fallout from my sublet falling through
- Drove to San Mateo

Tuesday 2015-11-06
------------------

- CWL Workshop at the Festival of Genomics, California
  - Well over 50 participants!
- Had many great conversations including one with Matt Bookman of the Google
  Cloud team. He is working with ISB on their CWL-on-Kubernetes development.
- Sketched out how to use the "streamable" flag to optimize use of object
  stores such as Google Cloud Storage. Discussed using the GCS FUSE adapter
  instead of using GCS URIs in CWL documents. A complete win for that design
  decision.

Wednesday 2015-11-07
--------------------

- CWL Codefest
- Was really more of a core team summit
- Lots of useful discussion on draft 3 features. Notes are at:
  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AXMDv7Zy7D68XbbGjv4pIKw69H31_gfYn5Hk6RGl--M
- Undecided issues: specifiying how to satisfy tool dependencies without using
  Docker
- Drove back to Davis

Thursday 2015-11-08
-------------------

- Finished moving out of my apartment. Missed my flight to Austin by mere
  minutes.
- Read ansible documentation

Friday 2015-11-09
-----------------

- Got up at 03:30 for my rescheduled flight to Austin; second leg was canceled,
  "bonus" 10-hour layover
- talk prep for TACC

To do
-----

- Get `Andrey Kartashov's recently contributed workflows
  <https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows/tree/master/workflows/scidap>`_
  running for myself.
- Setup Jenkins CI server to test CWL  conformance
- Start the sustainability review.
- Start an ontological comparison between the semantics of CWL tool and
  workflow descriptions and `the other known efforts
  <https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/wiki/Existing-Workflow-systems>`_.
- Follow up with the Software Freedom Conservancy and NumFOCUS.
